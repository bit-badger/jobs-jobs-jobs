# Jobs, Jobs, Jobs Version 3

Version 3 of Jobs, Jobs, Jobs is now available! This major release covers:

- Separating accounts from their Mastodon dependence
- Supporting chronological employment history in profiles
- Allowing profiles to be shared publicly
- Printing employment profiles
- Simplifying the infrastructure on which it runs

## Come One, Come All, Human Resources!

Previous versions utilized Mastodon and its API to authorize users with No Agenda-affiliated instances. This ended up being both too restrictive and unreliable. Version 3 handles user accounts itself, so registration is not tied to another service.

## Migrating Your Information from v2

The content from v2 is available in v3, but will not be visible until it is associated with a v3-created account. If you had content in v2, you should have received a message from @danieljsummers on No Agenda Social with instructions. _(NOTE: ITM, Slaves! and Liberty Woof have closed, so these people could not be reached directly.)_ The process is:

- [Create an account](https://noagendacareers.com/citizen/register)
- Verify that account
- Reply to the private message on Mastodon with the information requested

v2 data will be removed at some point after June 1st, 2023.

## How Does It Work?

Jobs, Jobs, Jobs is a job site that supports both employment profiles and job listings, allowing its users to either look for or recruit qualified people from the No Agenda tribe. The best way to get started would be to [look over the help files](https://noagendacareers.com/how-it-works). Then, register for an account, copy/paste your r&eacute;sum&eacute; there, or take a bit more time and fill out a full employment profile. If you are a person who hires or recruits, post your open positions.

In short - **use it**; a site like this only works if it provides value, and it has no value without your participation.
