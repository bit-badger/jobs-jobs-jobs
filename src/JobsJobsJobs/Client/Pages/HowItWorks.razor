<h4>Completing Your Profile</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    The &ldquo;View Your Employment Profile&rdquo; link (which you&rdquo;ll see on this page, once your profile is
    established) shows your profile the way all other validated users will be able to see it. While this site does not
    perform communication with others over No Agenda Social, the name on employment profiles is a link to that
    user&rsquo;s profile; from there, others can communicate further with you using the tools Mastodon provides.
  </li>
  <li>
    The &ldquo;Professional Biography&rdquo; and &ldquo;Experience&rdquo; sections support Markdown, a plain-text way
    to specify formatting quite similar to that provided by word processors. The
    <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">original page</a> for the project is a good
    overview of its capabilities, and the pages at
    <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/" target="_blank">Markdown Guide</a> give in-depth lessons to make the most
    of this language. The version of Markdown employed here supports many popular extensions, include smart quotes
    (turning "a quote" into &ldquo;a quote&rdquo;), tables, super/subscripts, and more.
  </li>
  <li>
    Skills are optional, but they are the place to record skills you have. Along with the skill, there is a
    &ldquo;Notes&rdquo; section, which can be used to indicate the time you&rsquo;ve practiced a particular skill, the
    mastery you have of that skill, etc. It is free-form text, so it is all up to you how you utilize the field.
  </li>
  <li>
    The &ldquo;Experience&rdquo; field is intended to capture a chronological or topical employment history; with this
    &ldquo;quick-n-dirty&rdquo; implementation, this Markdown box can be used to capture that information however you
    would like it presented to fellow citizens.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/bit-badger/jobs-jobs-jobs/issues/5" target="_blank">Phase 5</a> includes allowing
    public access to the continent, region, and skills fields of Gitmo Nation citizens who indicate that they are both
    seeking employment <strong>and</strong> want their information disclosed to public users. The &ldquo;Allow my
    profile to be searched publicly&rdquo; checkbox, at the bottom of the page where you edit your employment profile,
    is how you opt your profile in to this list.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Searching Profiles</h4>
<p>
  The &ldquo;View Profiles&rdquo; link at the side allows you to search for profiles by continent, the citizen&rsquo;s
  desire for remote work, a skill, or any text in their professional biography and experience. If you find someone with
  whom you&rsquo;d like to discuss potential opportunities, the name at the top of the profile links to their No Agenda
  Social account, where you can use its features to get in touch.
</p>

<h4>Finding Employment</h4>
<p>
  If your profile indicates that you are seeking employment, and you secure employment, that is something you will
  want to update (and &ndash; congratulations!). From both the Dashboard and the Edit Profile pages, you will see a
  link that encourages you to tell us about it. Click either of those links, and you will be brought to a page that
  allows you to indicate whether your employment actually came from someone finding your profile on Jobs, Jobs, Jobs,
  and gives you a place to write about the experience. These stories are only viewable by validated users, so feel free
  to use as much (or as little) identifying information as you&rsquo;d like. You can also submit this page with all the
  fields blank; in that case, your &ldquo;Seeking Employment&rdquo; flag is cleared, and the &ldquo;story&rdquo; is
  recorded.
</p>
<p>
  As a validated user, you can also view others success stories. Clicking &ldquo;Success Stories&rdquo; in the sidebar
  will display a list of all the stories that have been recorded. If there is a story to be read, there will be a link
  to read it; if you submitted the story, there will also be an &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; link.
</p>

<h4>
  Publicly Available Information
  <em><small>(coming in <a href="https://github.com/bit-badger/jobs-jobs-jobs/issues/5" target="_blank">Phase 5</a>)</small></em>
</h4>
<p>
  The &ldquo;public&rdquo; page for profile information will display the following information:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A count of profiles where the citizen is seeking employment</li>
  <li>The citizen&rsquo;s continent and region</li>
  <li>The citizen&rsquo;s skills and notes</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This information will be pullled only from profiles where citizens have said can it be publicly available
  <strong>and</strong> are currently seeking employment.
