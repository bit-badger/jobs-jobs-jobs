<h3>Account Deletion Options</h3>

<h4>Option 1 &ndash; Delete Your Profile</h4>
<p>
  Utilizing this option will remove your current employment profile and skills. This will preserve any success stories
  you may have written, and preserves this application&rsquo;s knowledge of you. This is what you want to use if you
  want to clear out your profile and start again (and remove the current one from others&rsquo; view).
</p>
<p class="text-center">
  <button class="btn btn-danger" @onclick=@DeleteProfile>Delete Your Profile</button>
</p>

<hr>

<h4>Option 2 &ndash; Delete Your Account</h4>
<p>
  This option will make it like you never visited this site. It will delete your profile, skills, success stories, and
  account. This is what you want to use if you want to disappear from this application. Clicking the button below
  <strong>will not</strong> affect your No Agenda Social account in any way; its effects are limited to Jobs, Jobs,
  Jobs.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    (This will not revoke this application&rsquo;s permissions on No Agenda Social; you will have to remove this
    yourself. The confirmation message has a link where you can do this; once the page loads, find the
    <strong>Jobs, Jobs, Jobs</strong> entry, and click the <strong>&times; Revoke</strong> link for that entry.)

<p class="text-center">
  <button class="btn btn-danger" @onclick=@DeleteAccount>Delete Your Entire Account</button>
